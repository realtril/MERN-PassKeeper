# MERN-PassKeeper
This is a test task for GBSFO - MERN stack password manager.

Here is a link where you check the app and play with it - https://mern-gbsfo-passkeeper.web.app/register .

To check an app out:
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open the folder with the copied repository and execute the command (npm i) to install npm packages. Initialize "npm i" in frontend & backend folders.
3) Open a "frontend" directory, run the "npm run client" command to launch the application.

P.S: Code fixes are yet to come.
